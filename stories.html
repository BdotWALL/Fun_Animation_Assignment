        <h3 class="animate_animated animate__zoomIn">50 Cent</h3>
            <p class="animate_animated animate__flipInX">
                50 Cent was born in South Jamaica, Queens, one of the poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods in 
                New York City. He was raised by his mother, Sabrina, who had him when she was just a teenager and 
                made money by dealing drugs. As she had become such a powerful drug dealer in the 
                area, she made enemies and was subsequently killed in a fire when Curtis was just eight years old.
                Following in his mother's footsteps, 50 started dealing drug like heroin and cocaine at the age of 12
                and became the new neighborhood kingpin when he was just 19 years old. He also started making enemies because 
                of this at the time. On May 24, 2000, 50 Cent was shot outside of his grandmother's house nine times.
                Scared from this experience, Curtis became inspired to focus on making his rap music and quit selling drugs altogether.
                50's debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin', was certified six times platinum, and skyrocketed his popularity instantly.
                This made it easy for him to release all of his following albums, and those he made with his group, G-Unit.
                From there, 50 Cent moved up in the world, becoming an executive producer, a shareholder of a popular vodka brand, Effen Vodka, 
                and to other endeavours outside of the music industry.

        <h3 class="animate_animated animate__zoomIn">Kanye West</h3>
            <p class="animate_animated animate__flipInX">Kanye comes from a strong household, where his mother was an English professor, and his father was a 
                photojournalist and former Black Panther member.They divorced when Kanye was just 3, and 
                his mother, Donda, was the one that raised him. After the divorce, she moved them to Chicago, where she taught college courses.
                Donda was the supportive, driving force behind Kanye's early musical career. She even helped fund his first record, when he was 13.
                A local producer in Chicago, No I.D., heard the demo, and took West under his wing to help teach him about how to make music.
                He described Kanye as “the most persistent person who I've ever met.” Kanye tried to go to college, which his mother encouraged, but he dropped out to pursue music. 
                (It's worth noting that his first major album is titled College Dropout.) He got even more serious about music, and started selling his beats.
                He got his big break when he finally sold a beat for $8,000 to artist Gravity. Afterward, he sold another beat to producer Jermaine Dupri.
                With this success, he moved to New Jersey so that he could more easily try and sell his beats to 
                artists and labels in New York City. Shortly after, he started producing for several big artists at the time, including Dead Prez, 
                Mase, Goodie Brown, and Jay-Z. He quickly tired of making beats for everyone else and wanted to start making his own music.
                Two weeks after ending up in a nearly-fatal car crash, West recorded a mixtape that included the 
                single “Through the Wire,” which he recorded with his jaw wired shut. This in turn got him the 
                opportunity to finish his first album, which was launched his successul career. 
                From there, he has produced several more albums, collaborated with other artists, and even stretched beyond music, 
                branching into fashion.

        <h3 class="animate_animated animate__zoomIn">Snoop Dogg</h3>
            <p class="animate_animated animate__flipInX">
                He was born and raised in Long Beach, California in a time when gang wars dominated the neighborhood.
                Snoop was forced to choose a side, and joined the Rollin' 20 Crips when he was a teenager. He was 
                arrested several times while in high school for selling drugs. When Calvin found rap, however, he 
                began to focus on that, rather than the streets. He began rapping under the name Snoop Doggy Dogg, 
                with his friends and fellow artists Nate Dogg and Warren G. His first performance was on Death Row 
                Records in 1992 with featured producer and artist Dr. Dre on his song “Deep Cover.” Roughly one year after 
                that, Snoop released his debut solo album, Doggystyle, and pretty much instantly became popular and a 
                household name, representing the West Coast rap style. Snoop is still popular today, more than 20 
                years later. He has released over 15 albums, and fleshed out his resume with his dispensary business,
                 and the production of his own TV series. He is still occasionally touring with new hip hop acts, 
                 and appearing on television shows with Martha Stewart.

        <h3 class="animate_animated animate__zoomIn">Travis Scott</h3>
            <p class="animate_animated animate__flipInX">On April 30, 1991, Jacques Berman Webster II, whom we know today as Travis Scott, was born in 
                Houston, Texas. When Scott turned 16, it was then that he found his interest in music 
                through producing music and making beats. In fact, he loved it so much that he moved to Los Angeles 
                to pursue music more seriously. He lived with friends, sleeping on a couch for two years while he worked in the studio.
                He dropped out of college at the University of Texas - without telling his parents - and used the 
                money that would have paid for his formal education to pay for plane tickets between Los Angeles 
                and Texas. His mom was so mad when she found out that she didn't speak to him for several months.
                But it paid off. Rapper T.I. heard his beats and ended up collaborating with Travis on his track 
                “Animal.” Soon after that, Kanye West's engineer linked up with him, and Travis eventually got to
                meet Kanye at a listening party. Kanye was impressed with Scott, and let him produce some of the 
                songs on his Cruel Summer album. Now he is directing music videos in addition to creating new music. He is even working with and dating singer Rihanna.
